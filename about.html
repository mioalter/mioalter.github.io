            <p>I am a software engineer from, and based in, NYC.
I love functional programming and have worked mostly in Scala on data engineering,
machine learning, and machine learning infrastructure.
Before moving to industry, I completed a BA in Cinema Studies and a PhD in Math.
I lived in Paris for two years as a kid and still speak French fluently.
I enjoy movies, cycling, cooking, natural wine, and large poodles.</p>
