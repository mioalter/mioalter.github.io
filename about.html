            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I am a software engineer from, and based in, NYC. I am a functional programmer and have worked mostly in Scala on data engineering, machine learning, and machine learning infrastructure. Outside of work, I enjoy movies, cooking, natural wine, and large poodles. I lived in Paris for two years as a kid and still speak French fluently. I have a BA in Cinema Studies and a PhD in Math so you could say that I am exceptionally well rounded.</p>
