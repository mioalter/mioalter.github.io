        <p>Equivalence relations are very useful and total ubiquitous in math and programming,
yet less widely known to programmers than other ideas from algebra like monoids
and groups.
We’ll do a few examples here to see how some familiar things
are defined in terms of equivalence relations,
continue with an application—how to turn any commutative monoid into a group—and
end with some examples of that construction.</p>
<p>We’ll start quite gently then pick up momentum.
Hopefully this is useful and interesting to programmers with a wide range
of mathematical experience.</p>
<h3 id="modular-arithmetic">Modular Arithmetic</h3>
<p>First, informally: to do arithmetic mod 7, we add, subtract, and multiply integers
as usual,
but with the understanding that if we have two integers whose difference is a
multiple of 7,
we consider them the same in the same way that we consider 1/2 and 2/4 as the same.
So, 0, 7, 14, -7, -28 are all different ways of writing the same number in
arithmetic mod 7.
Any number mod 7 is the same as one of the numbers between 0 and 6,
inclusive because we can always add or subtract enough 7s to get into that
interval so we usually choose one of those to make our lives easier.</p>
<p>Here is a nice visual way to think about this:
take the number line, mark off all the integers—positive, negative, and zero—and
wind it into an infinite vertical spiral so that <span class="math inline">… − 14,  − 7, 0, 7, 14…</span>
are
stacked on top of each other, <span class="math inline">… − 13,  − 6, 1, 8, 15, …</span>
are stacked on top of each other, <span class="math inline">… − 12,  − 5, 2, 9, 16, …</span>
are stacked on top of each other, etc.</p>
<p>So we go 7 steps around the spiral to go one level up.
Now, let’s imagine we have a flat plane below our spiral and a light above it,
and we shine the light down onto the plane.
The shadow of our spiral is a circle with 7 points on it.
One point in the circle is the shadow of all the points
<span class="math inline">… − 14,  − 7, 0, 7, 14, …</span>
another is the shadow of all the points
<span class="math inline">… − 13,  − 6, 1, 8, 15…</span> and so on.</p>
<p>Let’s write <span class="math inline">[0]</span> for “the point in the circle which is the shadow of
all the points <span class="math inline">… − 14,  − 7, 0, 7, 14…</span>”
and similarly for the other numbers.
Obviously, <span class="math inline">[0]</span>, <span class="math inline">[7]</span>, <span class="math inline">[14]</span>, <span class="math inline">[−28]</span> are all different ways of
writing the same point in the circle so shadow notation is not unique,
but that’s not a huge surprise.</p>
<p>Now, can we do arithmetic on our shadow circle using the fact that we know how
to do arithmetic on the number line? Yes, here’s how: given two shadow points
<span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>, we can say:
choose a number whose shadow is <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span>,
choose a number whose shadow is <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>,
add them, and take its shadow.
That’s the definition of addition of shadow points.
In notation: <span class="math inline">[<em>a</em>] + [<em>b</em>] = [<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>]</span>.
That is: the sum of the shadows is the shadow of the sum.
A reasonable question is: since there are infinitely many numbers whose
shadow is <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> and infinitely many numbers whose shadow is <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>,
will I get the same answer as you do if I choose different numbers whose
shadows are <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> than you do? Yes.</p>
<p>Colloquially, when we say “let’s compute <span class="math inline">3 + 11 mod  7</span>” we may be thinking
of <span class="math inline">3</span> and <span class="math inline">11</span> as integer integers or we may be thinking of them as integers mod 7;
in either case, what we do is add them as integers, get <span class="math inline">14</span>,
then remember that <span class="math inline">14</span>, <span class="math inline">7</span>, <span class="math inline">0</span>, etc. are all the same mod 7.
Since we can add any multiple of <span class="math inline">7</span> to <span class="math inline">3</span>, <span class="math inline">11</span>, or both and get the same answer,
we don’t worry too much if we are starting out with integer integers or
integers mod 7 which is a bit confusing.</p>
<p>The punchline is: arithmetic <span class="math inline"> mod  7</span> is actually shadow arithmetic downstairs
on the circle which we define in terms of ordinary arithmetic upstairs in the spiral,
ordinary integer arithmetic. We need a little formalism to make this concrete.</p>
<h3 id="relations-and-equivalence-relations">Relations and Equivalence Relations</h3>
<p>Given a set <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span>, a relation on <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> is a subset of ordered pairs of elements of <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span>:
the pairs of elements that are related according to the relation.
Equivalently, a relation is a subset of S x S;
equivalently, a relation is a function <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> × <em>S</em> → {0, 1}</span> which,
for each pair <span class="math inline">(<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>)</span> is <span class="math inline">1</span> if <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> is related to <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> and <span class="math inline">0</span> otherwise.
That’s it. We write <span class="math inline"><em>a</em> ∼ <em>b</em></span> as a shorthand for “<span class="math inline">(<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>)</span> is in the relation <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span>”
when it is clear which relation we are talking about.</p>
<p>Here’s a familiar example: take <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> to be the integers, and define the relation “<span class="math inline"><em>a</em> ∼ <em>b</em></span> if (and only if) <span class="math inline"><em>b</em> − <em>a</em></span> is a multiple of <span class="math inline">7</span>”;
some pairs in this relation are <span class="math inline">(0,7)</span>, <span class="math inline">(0,14)</span>, <span class="math inline">(3,10)</span>,
and some pairs not in this relation are <span class="math inline">(1,2)</span> and <span class="math inline">(4,13)</span>.</p>
<p>A particularly nice kind of relation is an equivalence relation.
This is a relation that satisfies three nice properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>reflexivity: <span class="math inline"><em>a</em> ∼ <em>a</em></span></li>
<li>symmetry: if <span class="math inline"><em>a</em> ∼ <em>b</em></span>, then <span class="math inline"><em>b</em> ∼ <em>a</em></span></li>
<li>transitivity: if <span class="math inline"><em>a</em> ∼ <em>b</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>b</em> ∼ <em>c</em></span>, then <span class="math inline"><em>a</em> ∼ <em>c</em></span></li>
</ul>
<p>In words: every element is related to itself; if <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> is related to <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>,
then <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> is related to <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span>;
if <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> is related to <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> is related to <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>, then <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> is related to <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>.</p>
<p>Given any set of people, “loves” is a relation that fails to be an equivalence
relation on all fronts:
you do not necessarily love yourself,
if you love someone, they may not love you,
and if you love someone and they love someone else, you may or may not love
that someone else.
This joke is due to <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~rf/">Robert Friedman</a>.</p>
<p>A relation that is an equivalence relation is:
on the set of integers, “<span class="math inline"><em>a</em> ∼ <em>b</em></span> if and only if <span class="math inline"><em>b</em> − <em>a</em></span> is a multiple of 7”
(or, more generally, a multiple of any positive integer). Try it.</p>
<p>Another relation on the integers which is not an equivalence is
“<span class="math inline"><em>a</em> ∼ <em>b</em></span> if and only if <span class="math inline"><em>a</em> &lt; <em>b</em></span>.”</p>
<p>If anyone says <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/logic/TypesSS05/Extra/geuvers.pdf">“here are some axioms: reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity,”</a>(pdf)
you should say “it sounds like we have defined an equivalence relation.”</p>
<p>We can also take any relation and add to it the minimum number of pairs necessary
for it to satisfy some or all of these properties.
This is called the reflexive (or symmetric or transitive or equivalence)
relation generated by a relation.</p>
<p>More generally, we can think of a relation as a subset of <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> × <em>T</em></span> where
<span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span> may be different sets.
Given a set of terms and a set of types, typing in the sense of type theory
is a relation like this that satisfies some rules.
See <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/">Pierce</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll restrict to relations which are equivalence relations from here on out.</p>
<p>An equivalence relation on <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> defines a bunch of subsets of <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span>:
the subsets of elements related to each other via the relation.
We call these subsets <em>equivalence classes</em>.
If <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> is an element of <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span>, we write “the equivalence class of s” as <span class="math inline">[<em>s</em>]</span>.
This should start looking familiar now:
the equivalence classes in arithmetic mod 7 are exactly the subsets of integers
that all have the same shadow.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, we are conflating “the set of all points with the same shadow”
with the shadow point itself, but this shouldn’t be too confusing.
We have two sets—the set of shadow points and the set whose elements are sets of
points that all have the same shadow, i.e. the set of equivalence classes—and
a specific isomorphism between them, and we are identifying the two via our
chosen isomorphism so there is no ambiguity.</p>
<p>One useful thing about equivalence relations is that the equivalence classes
partition the set <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span>:
that is, every element of <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> is in exactly one equivalence class.
We can deduce this from three properties, e.g. <span class="math inline"><em>a</em> ∼ <em>a</em></span> so every element is
in at least one equivalence class, the equivalence class <span class="math inline">[<em>a</em>]</span>, and so on.
This is clearly the case with our circle.</p>
<p>Forming the set of equivalence classes is called “modding out” or “quotienting by”
the equivalence relation. We often write the set of equivalence classes as
<span class="math inline"><em>S</em>/∼</span> or <span class="math inline"><em>S̃</em></span> or <span class="math inline"><em>S̄</em></span>. We’ll stick with the first for annoying
LaTex-rendering reasons.</p>
<p>Finally, if we have some extra algebraic structure on <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span>, we can try to transport
it to <span class="math inline"><em>S</em>/∼</span>.
Having an equivalence relation doesn’t let us do this automatically,
but we’ll see examples where we can do it.</p>
<h3 id="modular-arithmetic-again">Modular arithmetic, again</h3>
<p>Arithmetic mod 7 one more time: <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> is the integers,
<span class="math inline"><em>S</em>/∼</span> is the set of equivalence classes <span class="math inline">[0], [1], …, [6]</span>,
the set of subsets of integers whose differences are multiples of 7,
and we can define addition on <span class="math inline"><em>S</em>/∼</span>, exactly as we did,
by <span class="math inline">[<em>a</em>] + [<em>b</em>] = [<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>]</span>.
The work left to do is to show that this is well-defined,
that we get the same answer no matter which element-whose-shadow-is-<span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> and
element-whose-shadow-is-<span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> we use to compute the result.
Let’s do this one out: if we choose different elements <span class="math inline"><em>a</em>’</span> and <span class="math inline"><em>b</em>’</span> that
are equivalent to <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>, the fact that they are equivalent to <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>
means we can write each as <span class="math inline"><em>a</em> + 7<em>m</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>b</em> + 7<em>n</em></span> for some integers <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>.
Then we compute <span class="math inline">[<em>a</em>′+<em>b</em>′] = [<em>a</em>+7<em>m</em>+<em>b</em>+7<em>n</em>] = [<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>+7(<em>n</em>+<em>m</em>)] = [<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>]</span>,
that is, <span class="math inline"><em>a</em> + <em>b</em> + 7(<em>n</em>+<em>m</em>) ∼ <em>a</em> + <em>b</em></span> since their difference is a multiple of 7.
Thus, our definition of <span class="math inline">[<em>a</em>] + [<em>b</em>]</span> is independent of which elements of
[a] and [b] we use to compute it so is well-defined.</p>
<p>More generally, we don’t just have addition:
the integers are a group—a ring, even!—and we can define a whole group structure
on the set of equivalence classes:
we also have an identity, <span class="math inline">[0]</span>, and additive inverses, <span class="math inline"> − [<em>a</em>]</span> is <span class="math inline">[−<em>a</em>]</span>.
With this group structure, the projection map <span class="math inline"><em>π</em> : <em>S</em> → <em>S</em>/∼</span>
which sends an integer to its equivalence class is a group homomorphism.
This is basically by construction: <span class="math inline"><em>π</em>(<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>) = <em>π</em>(<em>a</em>) + <em>π</em>(<em>b</em>)</span> since <span class="math inline"><em>π</em>(<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>) = [<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>]</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>π</em>(<em>a</em>) + <em>π</em>(<em>b</em>) = [<em>a</em>] + [<em>b</em>]</span>,
and we defined the latter to be the former.</p>
<p>Pithy summary: to do arithmetic mod 7, we</p>
<ul>
<li>define an equivalence relation on the integers</li>
<li>mod out by that equivalence relation, that is, form the set of equivalence classes</li>
<li>transport the group structure on the integers to the set of equivalence classes
by defining, e.g. <span class="math inline">[<em>a</em>] + [<em>b</em>] = [<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>]</span></li>
<li>do arithmetic downstairs, on the set of equivalence classes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-integers-from-the-natural-numbers">The integers from the natural numbers</h3>
<p>Here’s another example: suppose we only have the natural numbers
<span class="math inline">ℕ = 0, 1, 2, …</span>
Can we construct the integers from these?
Intuitively: yeah by, like, taking pairs of natural numbers where the first
component is the positive part and the second component is the negative part.
This actually works! Like so: take the set of ordered pairs <span class="math inline">ℕ × ℕ</span>.
Now <span class="math inline">ℕ</span> is a monoid under addition and we can define a monoid structure on
<span class="math inline">ℕ × ℕ</span> by doing addition component-wise:
<span class="math inline">(<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>) + (<em>c</em>,<em>d</em>) := (<em>a</em>+<em>c</em>,<em>b</em>+<em>d</em>)</span>.
Define an equivalence relation on <span class="math inline">ℕ × ℕ</span> by <span class="math inline">(<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>) ∼ (<em>a</em>+<em>n</em>,<em>b</em>+<em>n</em>)</span>
for any <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> ∈ ℕ</span>.</p>
<p>Visually: take the <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><em>y</em></span>-plane and consider the points with integer
coordinates that are both <span class="math inline"> ≥ 0</span>, the first quadrant.
This is <span class="math inline">ℕ × ℕ</span>.
Now, draw all of the lines with slope <span class="math inline">1</span>, the ones whose equation is <span class="math inline"><em>y</em> = <em>x</em> + <em>c</em></span>
for all integers <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>.
These lines are the equivalence classes.
Each of these lines intersects either the positive <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>-axis at a point of the form
<span class="math inline">(<em>a</em>,0)</span>, goes through the origin <span class="math inline">(0,0)</span>, or intersects the positive <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>-axis
at a point of the form <span class="math inline">(0,<em>b</em>)</span> so every equivalence class can be written
as <span class="math inline">[(<em>a</em>,0)]</span> or <span class="math inline">[(0,0)]</span> or <span class="math inline">[(0,<em>b</em>)]</span> (where <span class="math inline"><em>a</em>, <em>b</em> &gt; 0</span>).
Dropping the brackets and parentheses and writing <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> for the first,
<span class="math inline">0</span> for the second and <span class="math inline"> − <em>b</em></span> for the third,
we get the integers!</p>
<p>Less hand wavily: we can define a group structure on the set <span class="math inline">(ℕ×ℕ)/∼</span>
of equivalence classes, define a function <span class="math inline"><em>f</em> : (ℕ×ℕ)/ ∼  → ℤ</span>
by <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>[(<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>)] = <em>a</em> − <em>b</em></span>,
show that <span class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> is well-defined, show that <span class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> is a group homomorphism,
then show that it is, in fact, an isomorphism.
That’s how we get the integers.</p>
<p>The is a special case of a general construction as we are about to see.</p>
<p>So: if you are, say, futzing around with the λ-Calculus and you’ve got
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding">Church numerals</a> (natural numbers) and are looking around for a way to
define the integers, this will do it.</p>
<p>Exercise: define the rational numbers from the integers using a similar construction.
The equivalence relation is a little trickier to write down, but not bad.</p>
<h3 id="the-best-group-from-a-commutative-monoid">The best group from a commutative monoid</h3>
<p>I have been in many many conversations with programmers that go something like:
we have some monoid—data structure we know how to aggregate and that has a
zero/”neutral” element—and we want to be able to talk about subtraction, too,
and someone says “I know, let’s just take pairs of elements where the first
component is the positive part and the second component is the negative part!”
Yes, this works! With the caveat that we are working with equivalence classes
and will wind up with multiple ways to represent the same thing.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, what we just did is a special case of a totally general construction:
given any commutative monoid <span class="math inline">(<em>M</em>,+,0)</span>, we can define the analogous
equivalence relation on <span class="math inline"><em>M</em> × <em>M</em></span>—<span class="math inline">(<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>) ∼ (<em>a</em>+<em>m</em>,<em>b</em>+<em>m</em>)</span> for all <span class="math inline"><em>m</em> ∈ <em>M</em></span>—and
define a group structure on the set <span class="math inline">(<em>M</em>×<em>M</em>)/∼</span> of equivalence classes.
The inclusion map <span class="math inline"><em>ι</em> : <em>M</em> → (<em>M</em>×<em>M</em>)/∼</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>ι</em>(<em>m</em>) = [(<em>m</em>,0)]</span>
is a monoid homomorphism.</p>
<p>This is “the best group we can make from <span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span>” in the following sense:
suppose we have another monoid <span class="math inline"><em>N</em></span> and a monoid homomorphism <span class="math inline"><em>M</em> → <em>N</em></span>,
if <span class="math inline"><em>N</em></span> happens to actually be a group, we get, for free, a unique group homomorphism
<span class="math inline">(<em>M</em>×<em>M</em>)/ ∼  → <em>N</em></span>.
Another way to say this is that <span class="math inline">(<em>M</em>×<em>M</em>)</span> satisfies a universal property.
This group is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck_group"><em>Grothendieck group</em></a> of the commutative monoid <span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span>.</p>
<h3 id="some-grothendieck-groups">Some Grothendieck groups</h3>
<p>Let’s do some programming-ish examples.</p>
<p>For any datatype <code>A</code>, we have the datatype <code>Set[A]</code> of sets (no repeated elements)
of values of type <code>A</code>.
This is a commutative monoid under union of sets,
where the empty set is the identity element.
We can form the Grothendieck group of this commutative monoid, but it is not
very interesting: we get the trivial group.
To see this, observe that</p>
<p><span class="math display">(<em>s</em>,<em>t</em>) ∼ (<em>s</em>,<em>t</em>) + (<em>s</em>+<em>t</em>,<em>s</em>+<em>t</em>) = (<em>s</em>+<em>s</em>+<em>t</em>,<em>t</em>+<em>s</em>+<em>t</em>) = (<em>s</em>+<em>t</em>,<em>s</em>+<em>t</em>) ∼ (<em>e</em><em>m</em><em>p</em><em>t</em><em>y</em>,<em>e</em><em>m</em><em>p</em><em>t</em><em>y</em>)</span></p>
<p>thus every pair <span class="math inline">(<em>s</em>,<em>t</em>)</span> in <code>Set[A] x Set[A]</code> is equivalent to <code>(empty, empty)</code>
so we have the trivial group.</p>
<p>Next, we can consider the datatype <code>MultiSet[A]</code> where we are allowed to have
repeated elements, but ordering doesn’t matter.
<code>MultiSet[A]</code> is isomorphic to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_monoid">free commutative monoid</a> on <code>A</code> and
its Grothendieck group is isomorphic to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_abelian_group">free Abelian (commutative) group</a>
on <code>A</code>.
Working out this isomorphism is analogous to showing that the Grothendieck group
of the natural numbers is isomoprhic to the integers,
you can just write it down and show it or, since there are also free things and
universal properties floating around, you can use those, too.</p>
<p>The Grothendieck group of <code>MultiSet[A]</code> is called <em>bags with signed multiplicities</em>
in the <a href="https://inc-lc.github.io">Incremental λ-Calculus</a> and used there as a <em>change structure</em>
to define the derivative of a program.
As the name suggests, it consists of unordered bags of elements with integer
multiplicities.</p>
<p>Since we can count the <em>total</em> number of elements in a multiset, we can count
the total number of changes, i.e. the total number of things in an element
of its Grothendieck group. Here’s the general construction.</p>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> is a datastructure that comes
equipped with a homomorphism <span class="math inline"><em>c</em><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>n</em><em>t</em> : <em>M</em> → ℕ</span>.
Now suppose that we want to use <span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> to keep track of both additions and
deletions/subtractions of things so want to turn it into something fancier that has
a homomorphism to the integers.</p>
<p>As a first step toward constructing the Grothendieck group of <span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span>,
let’s form <span class="math inline"><em>M</em> × <em>M</em></span> and consider the function <span class="math inline"><em>f</em> : <em>M</em> × <em>M</em> → ℤ</span>
defined by <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>) = <em>c</em><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>n</em><em>t</em>(<em>a</em>) − <em>c</em><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>n</em><em>t</em>(<em>b</em>)</span>.
This is a homomorphism and it descends to a well-defined homomorphism
<span class="math inline"><em>f̃</em> : (<em>M</em>×<em>M</em>)/ ∼  → ℤ</span> defined by <span class="math inline"><em>f̃</em>([(<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>)]) = <em>f</em>(<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>)</span>.
This is well-defined because <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>a</em>+<em>m</em>,<em>b</em>+<em>m</em>) = <em>f</em>(<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>)</span>.</p>
<p>So, if we can find a commutative monoid <span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> with a homomorphism to the
natural numbers, we can use its Grothendieck group to keep track of both
additions and subtractions of things and count the number of those using
our induced homomorphism to the integers.</p>
<p>We can do this with <code>MultiSet[A]</code> to count the total number of changes, but
we can’t do it to count the number of <em>distinct</em> changes:
the problem is that the number of distinct elements in
a union of multisets is definitely not the sum of the numbers of distinct
elements in each.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.github.io/algebird/datatypes/approx/hyperloglog.html">HyperLogLog</a> is a cool datastructure for counting the <em>approximate</em> number of
distinct elements in a multiset which <em>does</em> form a commutative monoid in
exactly the way you would want:
so that the function that sends a multiset to an HLL into which the elements of
that multiset have been inserted is a homomorphism.
So we could form its Grothendieck group, but our counting construction
would fail again for the same reason:
that <span class="math inline"><em>a</em><em>p</em><em>p</em><em>r</em><em>o</em><em>x</em><em>C</em><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>n</em><em>t</em> : <em>H</em><em>L</em><em>L</em> → ℕ</span> is not a homomorphism.
We can only ask the approximate count of distinct elements
<em>after</em> we’ve added all our HLLs. Sad trombone.
This might not be the most useful Grothendieck group as a result,
but there you have it.</p>
<p>Finally, in math, it is pretty common to have a commutative monoid
that you want to turn into a group:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_K-theory">topological K-theory</a>, a basic tool in algebraic topology,
is one example.</p>
<p>Exercise: There is nothing special about the natural numbers in our counting
construction: for any homomorphism <span class="math inline"><em>f</em> : <em>M</em> → <em>N</em></span> of commutative monoids,
define the induced homomorphism <span class="math inline"><em>f̃</em></span> of Grothendieck groups.
What if we have two: <span class="math inline"><em>f</em> : <em>M</em> → <em>N</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>g</em> : <em>N</em> → <em>O</em></span>?
How are the homomorphism induced by <span class="math inline"><em>g</em> ∘ <em>f</em></span>
and <span class="math inline"><em>g̃</em> ∘ <em>f̃</em></span> related?
What does this say in category theory terms abut the Grothendieck group?</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>That’s it! Equivalence relations, modular arithemtic,
constructing the integers from the natural numbers,
the Grothendieck group, and some examples of it.
I hope you enjoyed.</p>
