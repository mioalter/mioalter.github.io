        <h1>A Couple of Flat Circles</h1>
        <p>I was listening to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/podcasts/series/money-stuff">a podcast</a> recently and one of the hosts said
“time is a flat circle.” Only tangentially—pun intended!—related to the meaning
of that phrase, I started thinking about two different descriptions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus">torus</a>
(which is a pair of circles): one flat, one not.
This post will describe those two ways of viewing the torus.</p>
<p>The real point, though, is to answer the question: what does it even mean for a
non-Euclidean space to be flat or not flat?
So really, this a brief introduction to non-Euclidean geometry.</p>
<p>The punchline about the tori will come at the end once we set everything up.
I’m very intentionally keeping this light on details and heavy on intuition.
I’ll freely include links to wikipedia and textbooks for anyone interested in going deeper.
My hope is that anyone with vague memories of calculus will be able to enjoy this.
I’ll use mathematical notation very sparingly and will include few-to-no pictures,
but only because I am lazy.
Drawing pictures is extremely helpful here and the linked references have some great ones.</p>
<h1 id="euclidean-spaces">Euclidean spaces</h1>
<p>We’ll write <span class="math inline">ℝ</span> (pronounced “R”) for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number">real number line</a> and refer to numbers
on the number line as “real numbers.”</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 1, 2, 3, …</span>, we’ll write <span class="math inline">ℝ<sup><em>n</em></sup></span> for the set of all <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>-tuples of real numbers.
So the xy-plane of high school geometry is <span class="math inline">ℝ<sup>2</sup></span> (pronounced “R-2”) and the 3-dimensional
xyz-space of calculus class is <span class="math inline">ℝ<sup>3</sup></span> (pronounced “R-3”).</p>
<p>The set <span class="math inline">ℝ<sup><em>n</em></sup></span> along with all of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space">familiar structure we are accustomed to</a>—
we can measure distances between points, say when sequences converge, etc.—
is variously called
“Euclidean space”,
“Euclidean <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>-space”,
“<span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>-dimensional Euclidean space”,
“Euclidean space of dimension <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>”,
“<span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>-dimensional space”,
or just “<span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>-space.”</p>
<p>When <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> is <span class="math inline">2</span>, we usually say “the plane” or the “the xy-plane”;
when <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> is <span class="math inline">3</span>, we usually say “<span class="math inline">3</span>-space”, “<span class="math inline">3</span>-dimensional space”, “xyz-space”
or some combination of these.</p>
<p>For everything that follows, <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> will be <span class="math inline">2</span>, <span class="math inline">3</span>, or <span class="math inline">4</span>.</p>
<h1 id="tangent-vectors">Tangent vectors</h1>
<p>Suppose we have a curve <span class="math inline"><em>α</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> (“alpha of t”) in <span class="math inline">3</span>-dimensional xyz-space,
that is, not only the path traced out by a particle moving in space,
but it’s position as a function of time.
So <span class="math inline"><em>α</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> is really a triple of functions <span class="math inline">(<em>x</em>(<em>t</em>),<em>y</em>(<em>t</em>),<em>z</em>(<em>t</em>))</span> that give the
x, y, and z coordinates of our particle as functions of time.</p>
<p>The derivative <span class="math inline"><em>α</em>′(<em>t</em>)</span> (“alpha prime of t”) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_vector">tangent vector</a>
to our curve. It is the velocity as a function of time.</p>
<h1 id="tangent-spaces">Tangent spaces</h1>
<p>Something extremely confusing happens in most calculus classes:
we write a curve in <span class="math inline">ℝ<sup>3</sup></span> as <span class="math inline"><em>α</em>(<em>t</em>) = (<em>x</em>(<em>t</em>),<em>y</em>(<em>t</em>),<em>z</em>(<em>t</em>))</span>,
we write its derivative as <span class="math inline"><em>α</em>′(<em>t</em>) = ⟨<em>x</em>′(<em>t</em>), <em>y</em>′(<em>t</em>), <em>z</em>′(<em>t</em>)⟩</span>
(pointedly using angle brackets instead of parentheses), and go to great lenghts
to emphasize that the velocity <span class="math inline"><em>α</em>′(<em>t</em>)</span> is a vector—a thing with
a magnitude and a direction that we can freely move around as long as we don’t
change its magnitude or direction—whereas the position <span class="math inline"><em>α</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> is not.
All fine so far: there is nothing so strange about position and velocity being
not exactly the same type of thing.
But then we throw a wrench in it by calling <span class="math inline"><em>α</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> a <em>vector</em>-valued function
which implies that positions are vectors, too, which we said they are not.</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>Well, there are really many different copies of <span class="math inline">3</span>-dimensional space:
there is the space of positions and, at each position, a space of all possible
tangent vectors. So there is the <span class="math inline">ℝ<sup>3</sup></span> that <span class="math inline"><em>α</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> lives in and, at every
point in that <span class="math inline">ℝ<sup>3</sup></span>, another <span class="math inline">ℝ<sup>3</sup></span> of the tangent vectors to all curves that pass
through that point.
It just happens that we have a standard way to think of all of these different
<span class="math inline">ℝ<sup>3</sup></span>s as a single <span class="math inline">ℝ<sup>3</sup></span>, so we do that, except for the parentheses vs. angle brackets thing,
and it ends up being very confusing.</p>
<p>The 20th century way to say this is: there is the space <span class="math inline">ℝ<sup>3</sup></span> and,
at each point <span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> in that space, there is the space of tangent vectors <span class="math inline"><em>T</em><sub><em>p</em></sub>ℝ<sup>3</sup></span>
(“T-P-R-3”) which is another <span class="math inline">ℝ<sup>3</sup></span>.
A space along with the spaces of tangent vectors at every point is called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle"><em>tangent bundle</em></a>. So really, calculus in <span class="math inline">ℝ<sup>3</sup></span> is the geometry/physics/dynamics
of the tangent bundle to <span class="math inline">ℝ<sup>3</sup></span>.</p>
<h1 id="curvature-is-a-second-derivative">Curvature is a second derivative</h1>
<p>The second derivative <span class="math inline"><em>α</em>″(<em>t</em>)</span> is a vector that tells us how our velocity
vector is changing, its magnitude <span class="math inline">|<em>α</em>″(<em>t</em>)|</span> tells us how quickly
our velocity is changing, ignoring the direction of change.</p>
<p>If the magnitude and direction of our velocity vector are constant, then we are moving
in a straight line and <span class="math inline">|<em>α</em>″(<em>t</em>)| = 0</span> .
If our velocity vector is changing,
then our curve is curving and <span class="math inline">|<em>α</em>″(<em>t</em>)| ≠ 0</span>.</p>
<p>So <span class="math inline">|<em>α</em>″(<em>t</em>)|</span> (suitably normalized) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature">curvature of our curve</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, but more briefly, if we have a surface in <span class="math inline">ℝ<sup>3</sup></span> described (“parameterized”)
by a function <span class="math inline"><em>α</em>(<em>u</em>,<em>v</em>) = (<em>x</em>(<em>u</em>,<em>v</em>),<em>y</em>(<em>u</em>,<em>v</em>),<em>z</em>(<em>u</em>,<em>v</em>))</span>,
then we can measure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature#Informal_definition">how quickly the tangent planes change</a>
as we move along the surface. This again measures rates of change
of (planes of) velocity vectors so is a second derivative.</p>
<p>This is the Gaussian—first half of the 19th-century—description of curvature
of curves and surfaces embedded in <span class="math inline">ℝ<sup>3</sup></span>.</p>
<p>What we’ll see next is the modern, Riemannian, description of curvature
which generalizes the Gaussian view to higher-dimensional, non-Euclidean, spaces.</p>
<p>Gauss’ machinery is already not bad! It’s enough to prove <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorema_Egregium">why a slice of pizza
doesn’t flop if you fold it</a>.</p>
