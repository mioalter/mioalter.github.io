<h1 id="what-even-is-a-derivative">What even is a derivative?</h1>
<p>We’ll do examples and make a few general claims along the way.</p>
<p>The tl;dr is: we usually think of the values of a function, its outputs,
and the values its derivative as living in the same place,
but they actually don’t.
When we think of them as living in the same place, it is because there
is some way to relate these two places so that we can think of them as the same,
but this is much more confusing than just thinking of them as different.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose we have a particle that is confined to move along a line and
write down a function that desribes its position as a function of time.
Let’s picture our line as being oriented so that numbers get more negative
going to the left and more positive going to the right, with zero in the middle.
Let’s say that our position function is <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>) = <em>t</em><sup>2</sup></span>.
This is just the function that takes a number and squares it.
We could just as well write it as <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>, but let’s write it as
<span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>) = <em>t</em><sup>2</sup></span> to remind ourselves to think of the input as time.</p>
<p>The derivative of <span class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> at time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 3</span> is the number <span class="math inline">6</span>, but what is that number?
It is the rate of change of the position of our particle: its velocity.
Saying “the derivative of <span class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> at <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 3</span> is <span class="math inline">6</span>” means
“at time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 3</span>, our particle is moving at a speed of <span class="math inline">6</span> to the right, i.e.,
in the positive direction.”</p>
<p>At time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 3</span> the position of our particle is <span class="math inline">3<sup>2</sup> = 9</span>.
Is there some time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> for which the position of our particle is <span class="math inline">6</span>?
Yes, <span class="math inline">$t = \sqrt6$</span>.
Do the <span class="math inline">6</span> which is the position of our particle at time
<span class="math inline">$t = \sqrt 6$</span> and the <span class="math inline">6</span> which is its velocity at time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 3</span> have anything to do
with each other? No. They are both numbers, but they mean different things.
Does the number <span class="math inline">6</span> which is the velocity of our particle at time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 3</span> have
anything to do with the number <span class="math inline">9</span> which is the position of our particle at time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 3</span>
or with the positions of the particle at different times?
Sure! The way that we compute that <span class="math inline">6</span> is by measuring the distance from
position <span class="math inline">9</span> to nearby positions, computing a ratio, and taking a limit (using the definition of the derivative).
So, yeah, velocities and positions are definitely related, but do the numbers which are velocities
and the numbers which are positions live in the same number line? No way.</p>
<p>Now let’s tweak our function a little and make a new function <span class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>t</em>) = (<em>t</em>,<em>t</em><sup>2</sup>)</span>.
This produces values which are not single numbers, put pairs of numbers which
we can think of as points in the xy-plane.
As <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> varies, $g(t) traces out a parabola in the xy-plane: a bowl shape
that sits on the <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>-axis, and opens up toward the positive <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>-axis.
This parabola is actually the graph of our function <span class="math inline"><em>f</em></span>, this is just not the way
we usually desribe it.
We can think of <span class="math inline"><em>g</em></span> as describing the position of a particle that moves in a
parabolic curve in the xy-plane.
At time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 3</span>, the position <span class="math inline"><em>g</em>(3)</span> of this particle is <span class="math inline">(3,9)</span> and if we compute
the derivative of <span class="math inline"><em>g</em></span> at time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 3</span>, we get <span class="math inline">(1,6)</span></p>
