<p>
Welcome! I am software engineer based in NYC.
I currently work on Machine Learning infrastructure at Spotify.
Before that, I worked on ML and ML infrastructure at Stripe,
including on <a href = "https://github.com/stripe/rainier">Rainier</a>,
a Scala library for Bayesian inference.
<p>
</p>
Prior to moving into industry, I received a PhD in Math from UT-Austin and,
some time before that, I worked at the infamous
<a href = "https://www.laweekly.com/news/mondo-kims-video-was-shipped-from-new-york-to-sicily-then-things-got-really-strange-2176383">Kim's Video</a>.
It turns out that having to figure out the point of really technical
things without getting lost in the details and
enjoying digging up esoteric historical connections—e.g. the <a href="https://cinemacats.com/darkman-1990/">cat in Darkman (1990)</a> is the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2469051/the-very-specific-reason-the-original-pet-sematary-chose-its-breed-of-cat">cat in Pet Sematary (1989)</a>—are both pretty useful skills in software!
</p>

<p>
I love functional programming.
I have the most experience writing Scala,
I am confortable writing Java,
and I'm generally excited about learning new things,
programming languages included.
