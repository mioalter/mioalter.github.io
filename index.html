Hello! I am a software engineer based in NYC.

<p>
I have built Machine Learning systems for both batch and real-time inference,
and co-authored <a href = "https://github.com/stripe/rainier">Rainier</a>,
a Scala library for Bayesian inference.

<p>
I most recently worked on the ML Platform team at Spotify; before that I worked at Stripe.
Prior to moving into industry, I received a PhD in Math from UT-Austin and,
some time before that, I worked at the infamous
<a href = "https://youtu.be/RLbTNL2eKIY?si=nPkiAN0vdh-1qDie">Kim's Video</a>.
It turns out that having to figure out how technical stuff works without getting
lost in the details and enjoying digging up esoteric connections between
things—e.g. that the
<a href="https://cinemacats.com/darkman-1990/">cat in Darkman (1990)</a> is the
<a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2469051/the-very-specific-reason-the-original-pet-sematary-chose-its-breed-of-cat">cat in Pet Sematary (1989)</a>—are
both pretty useful skills in software!
</p>

<p>
I am a big fan of types and functional programming.
Scala, Java, and Python are the langauges I have the most experience writing.
I have dabbled in a handful of others and I'm always excited to learn new things.
