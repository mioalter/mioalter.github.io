I am a sixth-year graduate student in mathematics at UT-Austin.  I am interested in topological K-theory and differential cohomology.  My thesis is a construction of differential circle-equivariant K-theory.  Under Conferences, Workshops, and Talks (below) are links related to differential cohomology and differential K-theory.  My advisor is Dan Freed.

<br><br>In Fall 2011, we had a Computational Algebraic Topology seminar.  I gave a talk entitled Minimization Problems as Eigenvector Problems.
<br>We also had an Everything An Algebraic Topologist Should Know seminar that semester in which I gave a talk on Adams' paper <a href="http://math.unice.fr/~cazanave/Gdt/ImJ/J-IV.pdf">J(X) IV</a> about the <a href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-homomorphism">J-homomorphism</a>.

In the Spring and Summer 2011 to prepare for the Comp Top workshop at Snowbird (above), we organized a Computational Algebraic Topology Graduate seminar here at UT.  I gave a talk entitled The Cech Complex, the Vietoris-Rips Complex, and Persistent Homology.  It was based on Carlsson's paper <a href="http://comptop.stanford.edu/u/preprints/topologyAndData.pdf">Topology and Data</a>.
<br>
<br>In February 2011, I gave an introductory talk on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_K-theory

<br>
<br>In February 2010, I gave a talk entitled An Introduction to Khovanov Homology in the Student Geometry seminar.  This was based on things I learned at the
