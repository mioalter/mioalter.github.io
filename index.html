Hello! I am software engineer based in NYC.
For the past 4 years I've have worked in mostly Scala
on data engineering, machine learning, and machine learning infrastructure.

Before that, I received a PhD in Math from UT-Austin and,

I'm pretty easy to find on the internet (if you don't get distracted by Italians
talking about their alter egos): a good bet is to email me at ${firstname}${lastname}@gmail.
