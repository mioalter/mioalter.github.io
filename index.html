<br> Welcome! I am a software engineer, geometer, functional programmer, and lover of movies and poodles! I am currently a software engineer at <a href="https://stripe.com/es">Stripe</a> where I work on machine learning for fraud detection, mostly in Scala.
<br>
<br>Before that, I was a data scientist at <a href="https://6sense.com/">6sense</a> where I worked on predictive analytics for sales and marketing. 
<br>
<br>Before that, I studied Geometry and Topology at UT-Austin and Columbia, and before that, I worked at the infamous <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/movies/kims-video-closes-and-a-village-sensibility-dies.html">Kim's Video</a> among other film-related things.
