<p>
Hello! I am software engineer based in NYC.
</p>
<p>
For the past 4 years I've have worked in mostly Scala
on data engineering, machine learning, and machine learning infrastructure,
including on <a href = "https://github.com/stripe/rainier">Rainier</a>, a Scala library for Bayesian inference.
<p>
</p>
Before that, I worked on machine learning, mostly in Python.
Prior to moving into industry, I received a PhD in Math from UT-Austin and,
some time before that, worked at the infamous
<a href = "https://www.laweekly.com/news/mondo-kims-video-was-shipped-from-new-york-to-sicily-then-things-got-really-strange-2176383">Kim's Video</a>.
