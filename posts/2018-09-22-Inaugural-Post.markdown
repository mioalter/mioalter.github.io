This blog is my excuse to learn new things.
Expect some very minimal introductions to concepts in type theory and
category theory aimed at understanding why programming implementations
of these ideas look the way they do.
Look out, too, for an introduction to the underlying math of
[auto differentiation][AD] including the chain rule and
differential forms on $\mathbb{R^n}$.
