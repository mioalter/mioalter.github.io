title: Inaugural post

This blog is my excuse to learn new things vaguely inspired by the
["What is...?"][AMS] series in the AMS.
Expect some very minimal introductions to concepts in type theory and
category theory aimed at understanding why programming implementations
of these ideas look the way they do.
Expect an introduction to the underlying math of [auto differentiation][AD]
including the chain rule and differential forms on $\mathbb{R^n}$.
