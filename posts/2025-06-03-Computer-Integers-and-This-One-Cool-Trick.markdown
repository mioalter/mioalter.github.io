title: Computer Integers and This One Cool Trick
---

A post about
- the algebra of computer integers
- the fact that _of course_ multiplication of signed and unsigned integers is the same
  at the bit-level: that comes for free from the fact that we get operations on both
  by pulling back from the same place
  (find the part in Bryant and O'Halloran)
- the one cool trick: pullback of structure
