\newcommand{\R}{\mathbb R}

Let's say we want to compute the surface area of a sphere of radius $R > 0$,
the set of points in $3$-dimensional xyz-space whose coordinates satisify
$x^2 + y^2 +z^2 = R^2$.

Let's parametrize the sphere with the function
$S(u,v) = (R\cos(u) \sin (v), R\sin (u) \sin (v), R\cos (v))$
where $0 \leq u < 2\pi$ and $0 \leq v < \pi$.
