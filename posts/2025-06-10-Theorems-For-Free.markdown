The post I have been meaning to write that this paper basically says "polymorphic functions between functors
in the lambda calculus are natural transformations" except that
1. there is no rigorous isomorphism between category theory and the polymorphic lambda calculus and
2. the result holds for polymorphic functions between polymorphic datatypes which are _not_ functors.

I had in mind to work out....I think why there is no functor $C to C^{op}$? I don't remember exactly.
I was going to factor something in terms of the diagonal functor.
Oh, maybe it was to show that there is not a _diagonal_ functor $C \to C \times C^{op}$? and to say that,
if there were, we could compose it with projection to get a functor $C \to C^{op}$, but that obviously doesn't work.
