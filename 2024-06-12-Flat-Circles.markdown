title: A Couple of Flat Circles OR What Even Is Curvature?
---
\newcommand{\R}{\mathbb R}

I was listening to [a podcast][money stuff] recently and one of the hosts said
"time is a flat circle." Only tangentially—pun intended!—related to the meaning
of that phrase, I started thinking about two different descriptions of the [torus][torus]
(which is a pair of circles): one flat, one not.
This is a post to describe those two ways of viewing a torus.

This is, in fact, a very brief introduction to non-Euclidean geometry.
The punchline about the tori will come at the end once we set everything up.
I will try very hard to focus on intuition and leave out as many details as possible.
I'll freely include links to wikipedia and textbooks instead.
My hope is that anyone with vague memories of calculus will be able to enjoy this.
I'd like this, as much as a written blog post can be, to like
we are walking down the street talking and I am wildly gesticulating with my hands,
rather than a lesson in front of a board.
I'll use mathematical notation very sparingly and will include no-to-very-few pictures.

# Euclidean spaces

# Tangent spaces

# Curavture is a second derivative

# Non-Euclidean spaces

# Length is speed times time

# Metrics

# Curvature again

# Flat and non-flat Tori
