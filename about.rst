title: About
---

I am a software engineer from, and based in, NYC.
I am a functional programmer and have worked mostly in Scala on data engineering,
machine learning, and machine learning infrastructure.
Outside of work, I enjoy movies, cooking, natural wine, and large poodles.
I lived in Paris for two years as a kid and still speak French fluently.
I have a BA in Cinema Studies and a PhD in Math so you could say that
I am exceptionally well rounded.
